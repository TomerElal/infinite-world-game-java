UML:
First we thought to create a factory for the leaves strategy, buy ended
up using callbacks insted, and a new class for leaf.
Second, we thought to separate the avatar object and the avatar creation,
but ended up implamenting both in the avatar class.
Also we defined the energy object in the avatar class since they are act
together and since the energy does not add something nore than a regular
gameObject.
And the highlight is that if it sounds like a tree-trunk or taste like a
leaf, or maybe looks like a fallen one - it is probebly a ground block.
Also, there was several places that we add composition to the class for
other object's game - but then we understood that the other classes just
created the objects with static function and did not represents them - so
we removed that.


Infinte world:
We created 3 frames of the world, and we are maintaining them every
moment. In each frame we keep all the objects there in a different layer,
which means 5 layer for each frame. By that when we decide to delete one
frame we can just delete all the objects in the 5 layers of this frmae
(of course only thoose who need to be deleted). That we do when the
avater is going out from the middle frame.


Tree:
we decided to have 4 classes in it.
The first is the Tree which get a range and creates trees in it.
The ssecond is the trunk which get only one x coordinate and creates
there a trunk.
The third is the Leaves that get the x coordinate also, creates on top of
the trunk the leaves.
The Trunk and the Leaves use static function for the creation.
And the last is the leaf object, that extants the Block object, and have
some more abilities.
This way each class has its own defiend and clear responsibilty, exept
the Leaf that is just a gameObject that add more fanctionality, so had to
be created.


Design:
We thought many time about using stategies for the leaves and factory for
creating them - but in the end we thought that this way, using only
callback and one leaf class representable is better and cleaner.
We thought that a lot of things in this game can be created just by using
the Block class so we used it, and only changes its color, or in the case
of the leaves, created a class that extends it.
